## How to Play
* First step is to press the “Play Now” button on the start screen
* Now, you can choose a number 1-6 at the top to place your pick
* In order to actually roll the dice, you must click on the dice  image in the middle of the screen
If you are correct in your guess, the number you chose will be added to your total score
* If you are incorrect in your guess, you will lose 2 points from your total score
* Example:
If you select 5 and it lands on 5, you will gain 5 to your total score
If you select 5 again and it lands on 2, you will lose 2 from your total score (making the total score equal to 3)
* For a further explanation of the rules, you can click the “Show Rules” button when the game loads
